🌦 Building a Smart Weather App with AI & Flutter! 🌦
I developed a weather app that not only provides real-time weather updates for your current location or any city worldwide but also integrates AI-powered predictions to help you decide: Should you go out or not? 🤖☂️
🔹 Features:

✅ Search for any city's weather instantly 🔎
✅ AI model predicts whether it's a good idea to go out or stay in 🤔
✅ Built using Flutter Bloc for state management ⚡️
✅ Dependency Injection (DI) for better code structure 🏗
✅ Native splash screen for a seamless startup experience 🎨
✅ Integrated with Weather API & AI Model for accurate insights 🌦
